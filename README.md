Codes for "[A Generalized Scalarization Method for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01545)" (AAAI-23 Oral).

MOEA/D-GGR are implemented on the PlatEMO platform (version 3.x). Please place the codes in path "PlatEMO\Algorithms\Multi-objective optimization\MOEADGGR".

Additionally, we develop a generational version of MOEA/D-GGR (denoted as gMOEA/D-GGR), whose framework is similar to gMOEA/D-AGR of "Adaptive Replacement Strategies for MOEA/D". gMOEA/D-GGR could perform better when the reference point changes frequently.
