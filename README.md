Codes for "A Generalized Scalarization Method for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization" (AAAI-23).

MOEA/D-GGR are implemented on the PlatEMO platform (version 3.x). Please place the codes in path "PlatEMO\Algorithms\Multi-objective optimization\MOEADGGR".

Additionally, we develop a generational version of MOEA/D-GGR (denoted as gMOEA/D-GGR), whose framework is similar to gMOEA/D-AGR of "Adaptive Replacement Strategies for MOEA/D". gMOEA/D-GGR could have better performance when the reference point changes frequently.
